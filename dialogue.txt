LONG AGO IN THE 
LAND OF MERPROV,

A RUTHLESS RULER
FORGED THE      

CHRONO STONE,   
WHICH HAD THE   

POWER TO TRADE  
ANOTHER'S YOUTH 

FOR GAINING IT  
THEMSELVES.     
--
THE RULER WAS   
NOT STRONG      

ENOUGH TO DEFEND
AGAIN THE HORDES

SEEKING TO KILL 
HIM AND SIEZE   

THE CHRONO      
STONE.          

BEFORE HE DIED, 
HE HID THE STONE

BEHIND POWERFUL,
FOREIGN MAGIC   

AND NO ONE WAS  
ABLE TO FIND IT.

MEET FREDERIK A,
FIERCE WARRIOR  

WITH A STRONG   
REPUTATION,     

MARIE, A        
MYSTERIOUS WOMAN

WITH HIDDEN     
POWERS,         

AND BOSTON, AN  
EX-SOLDIER WITH 

A POWERFUL      
MACHINE GUN.    

YOU WILL HAVE TO
TRAVEL TO       

DISTANT LANDS   
AND OVERCOME    

MANY CHALLENGES 
ON YOUR QUEST TO

OVERCOME THE    
FORCES OF EVIL. 

A VILLIAGE WHERE
OUR HEROES HAVE 

BEEN LODGING HAS
JUST BEEN       

ATTACKED BY     
BANDITS!        

FREDERIK, MARIE,
AND BOSTON FEEL 

UNPREPARED FOR  
THE TASK BUT    

AREN'T SURE IF  
ANYONE ELSE IS  

ABLE TO DEFEND  
THE PEOPLE.     

THEY EACH GRAB  
THEIR WEAPONS   

AND RUSH TO THE 
SCENE OF BATTLE.

PRESS THE A     
BUTTON ON THE   

CHARACTER YOU   
WOULD LIKE TO   

MOVE, AND PRESS 
A AGAIN TO      

CONFIRM         
YOUR MOVE.      

YOU CAN ATTACK  
AN ENEMY OR PICK

UP AN ITEM AFTER
MOVING.         

FOR THIS MAP,   
YOU WILL HAVE TO

STAY ALIVE UNTIL
BACKUP ARRIVES. 

THE IMPERIAL    
ARMY FINALLY    

ARRIVE, HOWEVER,
THE BANDITS HAVE

ALREADY BEEN    
DEFEATED.       

OUR HEROES HAVE 
GAINED THE TRUST

AND RESPECT FROM
THE PEOPLE.

THANK YOU FOR  
SAVING US FROM 

THOSE BANDITS! 
HERE, HAVE SOME

HEALTH POTIONS 
AND WEAPONS.   

MARIE, DID YOU 
SEE THE STRANGE

MARKINGS ON    
THAT BANDIT'S  

CLOTHING?


I BELIEVE I'VE 
READ SOMETHING 

ABOUT THOSE    
IN THE LIBRARY 

THEY SEEM TO BE
CALLED THE     

BLOOD RAVAGERS,
AND HAVE A MAIN

FORTRESS JUST  
SOUTH OF HERE. 

THERE ARE NOT  
MANY OF THEM,  

BUT THE PEOPLE 
DO NOT HAVE    

ADEQUATE
SUPPLIES TO    

FIGHT THEM     
THEMSELVES.    

DO YOU THINK WE
CAN DRIVE THEM 

OUT FOR GOOD?  


POSSIBLY, BUT  
WE WILL NEED TO

PLAN OUR ATTACK
CAREFULLY AND  

NOT ATTACK THEM
ALL AT ONCE.   

OUR HEROES     
TRAVEL TO THE  

BLOOD RAVAGERS'
FORTRESS.      

THERE ARE NOT  
MANY ON PATROL 

TONIGHT, BUT   
MORE MAY COME  

IF YOU ARE NOT 
CAREFUL.


PREPARE FOR MY 
MIGHTY ~FLAME~ 

ATTACK!!!


YOU FOOLS! YOUR
WEAK INTELLECT 

IS NO MATCH    
FOR MY         

~CONCEPTS AND  
METHODS!!!~
